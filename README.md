Project description: it's a "developer Tinder", the developer enters with the github user and finds other devs, with the option to like or unlike, and then the match may happen.

Tindev is an application to practice mobile(React Native), web(ReactJs) and backend(Node, MongoDB).


Some things have to be done, one of them is to show the match if the user is logged out and he receives the match.
